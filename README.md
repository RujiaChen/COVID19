# COVID-19
Covid-19 has hit most of the countries across the world. To understand the evolution of corona virus is critical to both governments and individuals. Underestimation of its death rate and spreading speed largely affected the reactions and delayed the policy makings in some countries. One possible reason is that people used Chinaâ€™s data to model this virus without considering the influence of its strict social distancing. 

In this project, I will use a typical infectious model, SEIR, to modeling this virus first; Then compare the main parameters in several countries to measure the effect of social distancing and predict the evolution curves in the coming months. After having a better understanding of this virus, I will combine different features, like population density, public transportation coverage, connection to high-risk regions, etc. to predict the risk levels of different regions. This will help our government and individuals to arrange their business and life.
